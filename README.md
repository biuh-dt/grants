Please take a look at the Hainan Province Foreign Experts Program. If you know any foreign professors, you are welcome to invite them to apply for this program together. We encourage everyone to actively apply for provincial and national-level research projects. Successful applications will be rewarded with additional performance bonuses, which will be announced soon. We warmly welcome everyone's participation. Discipline leaders are also kindly asked to inform other teachers and professors in their respective fields. Thanks a lot
